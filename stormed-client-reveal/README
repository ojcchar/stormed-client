##Obtaining an API key
First of all, register on the [StORMeD] website to obtain an API.
Locate in the code all the strings `"your API key"` and put your newly obtained key instead. 

After this first step you are ready to run the examples either in Java or Scala via SBT or Maven.


----
## Running with SBT
Running the sample code with sbt is simple. Just type `sbt run` and the project will automatically compile and identify all the main classes that can be run. Select the example desired by typing the corresponding number.

### Importing in Eclipse
Sbt allows the creation of eclipse project by running `sbt eclipse`. Once run the previous command, the project can be imported in eclipse as *Existing Eclipse Project*.

----
## Running with Maven
The actual pom does not allow to directly run the examples from terminal. However, IDEs like Eclipse and IDEA can easily import and run the project.

### IDEA
For IDEA you need to install a plugin for scala before proceeding.

### Scala IDE
Given the presence of Scala code, you need to use a [Scala IDE] version of Eclipse. A normal Eclipse distribution will not work with this project.
